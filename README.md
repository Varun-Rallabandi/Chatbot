Magic 8 Ball Chatbot
This is a Python program that simulates a Magic 8 Ball, a toy used for fortune-telling or seeking advice. The user can ask a question, and the chatbot will generate a random response from a list of predetermined responses.

Installation
Install Python 3: This program requires Python 3 to be installed on your system. If you don't have Python 3 installed, you can download it from the official website: https://www.python.org/downloads/

Clone or download the repository: You can clone the repository using git or download the zip file from the repository page on GitHub.

Open the terminal or command prompt: Navigate to the directory where the program is saved using the terminal or command prompt.

Run the program: Type python magic_8_ball.py in the terminal or command prompt to start the program.

Usage
Start the program: Type python magic_8_ball.py in the terminal or command prompt to start the program.

Ask a question: Type your question and press enter. The chatbot will generate a random response from a list of predetermined responses.

Quit the program: Type "Q" and press enter to quit the program.

Technical Details
This program uses the random.choice method from the random module in Python to generate a random response from a list of predetermined responses. The list of responses is stored in a variable called responses.

The program uses a while loop to keep the program running until the user inputs "Q" to quit. The loop checks the user's input and generates a response using random.choice if the input is not "Q". If the input is "Q", the loop breaks, and the program exits.

Customization:
You can customize the responses by modifying the responses list. You can add, remove, or modify the responses to make the chatbot more personalized.

You can also add more features to the chatbot, such as saving the user's questions and responses to a file or database, or implementing a natural language processing (NLP) system to understand and respond to the user's questions more intelligently.

Conclusion
The Magic 8 Ball chatbot is a fun and simple program that demonstrates how to generate random responses and use a loop to keep a program running until the user decides to quit. You can use this code as a starting point for more advanced chatbots or other programs that require random generation or user input.
